== Screenshots ==

1. When users click the Register button, a DHTML pop-up appears. They can then choose which ID to use, or they can decide to just choose a password as usual.
2. Another option is to present an explicit choice to users before they hit the submit button. This makes the form bigger, but may be more reassuring for some users.
